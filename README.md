Happy to share, me and my Team KILLER (Nanotechx) participated in Microsoft Imagine Cup 2022 and among 300+ teams, and nominated the Winner of Microsoft Imagine Cup Regional Finals

It was a great learning experience ranging from tech and non tech things. We reached here by qualifying the knockout round and the semi finals, the journey till here wasn't easy but was worth it, we learnt a lot on how to improve upon our idea and how to present it well in next round (World Champion).

The Imagine Cup is a skill-based Competition. Open to students around the world. The Imagine Cup Competition seeks to honor the most innovative, accessible, ground-breaking, and appealing software built with Microsoft tools and technology.
The 2022 competition is designed to inspire students to use their imaginations and passion to create innovative technology solutions.
The following prizes will be given to the 2022 Imagine Cup World Champion:
USD100,000, Azure grant, and a mentoring session with Microsoft CEO.
